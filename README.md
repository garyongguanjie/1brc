My Attempt of 1billion row challenge https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc

Not much naive implementation

baseline.c -> ~ 2minutes

baseline2.c -> ~ 1 minute

fast.c -> 15s mmap+multithreaded, though occassionaly segfaults presumably due to concurrency

baseline.py -> ~ 15 minutes

baseline.js -> ~ 12 minutes

java reference implementation -> ~ 3 minutes
